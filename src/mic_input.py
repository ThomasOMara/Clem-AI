Convert speech from mic to text

- PyAudio to interface with mic

- SpeechRecognition to listen to mic and convert the audio into text via
  Google Web Speech API

- Note: need to be able to read the speech word-for-word (ie not poll every
  second or something in case you miss words)

- Maybe can do every x seconds and remove duplicate words
  (want to include them though

# I think you need to turn on port audio


# Then use pyaudio to create the stream


# Link this somehow to Google Web Speech API
